## Description

Based on your wireframing plan, you will consider how to best use video media for the site. Will you use video to introduce your data story, emphasize a particular point, or perhaps provide interesting insights into the data that your collected? You must decide how your video will best serve your narrative.

You will use video editing software specific to your particular operating system. Based on your choice of editing software, you will be sorted into groups that are more conducive for sharing resources and strategies. In class, I will review some more generic conventions that will provide us common ground, but I will also have you form <i>ad hoc</i> groups to analyze the communicative moves made by videos used similarly to your own.

## General process

1. Learn about some basic video composition conventions.
2. Learn how to seek out, analyze, choose, and adapt similar generic conventions to help you tell your data-story meaningfully.
3. Learn about basic video codec, file format, and HTML5 <code>&lt;video&gt;</code> issues and solutions, and then learn how to output video optimized for the web.
4. Create 3-5 minutes worth of video media, which can be split among more than 1 video.

## Rubric

Your video(s):

- Aligns and amplifies the narrative thread of your data-story: Uses secondary research to deepen a particular finding highlighted in your data visualization.
- Demonstrate meaningful decisions about what rhetorical purposes your videos fulfill for your future single-page site.
- Demonstrate application of basic composition strategies: Rule of Thirds, meaningful cuts/transitions (on motion, similar elements, or narrative connection), and source material pertinent to narrative.
