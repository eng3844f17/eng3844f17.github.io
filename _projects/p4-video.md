## Description

Based on your wireframing plan, you will consider how to best use video media for the site. Will you use video to introduce your data story, emphasize a particular point, or perhaps provide interesting insights into the data that your collected? You must decide how your video will best serve your narrative.

You will use video editing software specific to your particular operating system. Based on your choice of editing software, you will be sorted into groups that are more conducive for sharing resources and strategies. In class, I will review some more generic conventions that will provide us common ground, but I will also have you form <i>ad hoc</i> groups to analyze the communicative moves made by videos used similarly to your own.
