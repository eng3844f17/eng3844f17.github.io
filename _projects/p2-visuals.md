## Description

After collecting your data, you will analyze your data, developing categories and codes for you to visualize. You will analyze and explore your data in tandem with learning some basic visualization conventions. From there, you will make decisions about how you want to visualize your categories and their relationships.

We will all be using Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) to create our visualizations destined for your respective data-story websites. These markup, graphical objects have long since been around, but have made recent strides in functionality over the past decade in lieu of HTML5 documents. Consequently, SVG visuals have become integral digital media for web documents across design and content domains.

As a basic introduction, we will use the Inkscape application to create our draft visualization as a SVG file. We will learn about the basic SVG document structure (see image below), and prep it for our future data-story website.

## General process

1. Learn about the basic data visualization conventions.
2. Explore and analyze your data.
3. Learn and choose what conventions help you tell your data-story meaningfully.
4. Sketch your data visualization.
5. Learn basic Inkscape skills and create your drawing as an SVG.
6. Clean your SVG for the web, making it semantically rich.

## Rubric

- Data-Set and Data-Viz reflect each other: Overall design expresses the categorical relationships that you set out to emphasize
- Appropriate application of visualization conventions: Incorporates meaningful use of space and shapes to define and express your data story
- Ethically represents your findings: Data represents your findings without masking its flaws or creating an unbalanced relationship between datum.
- Legend articulates relationships clearly
- Incorporates contextual details that amplify your main narrative
- Semantically-rich SVG markup
