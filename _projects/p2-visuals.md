## Description

After collecting and working with your data, you should have some categories that have also been dimensionalized in meangingful ways. With these data, we will learn about some basic visualization conventions. From there, you will make decisions about how you want to visualize your categories and their relationships.

We will be using Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) to create our visualizations destined for your data story website. These markup graphical objects have long since been around, but have made recent strides in functionality within HTML5 documents. They are commonly used within web documents across design and content domains. Accordingly, we will use the Inkscape application to create our draft visualization as a SVG file.
