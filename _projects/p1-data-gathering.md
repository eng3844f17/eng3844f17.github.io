## Description

The main goal of this course starts here: collecting a 5 days of data. In this first project, you will collect the data necessary to complete all of the subsequent media projects in this course. To guide this process, we will all share the following broader research question: **What [writing practices](/assets/docs/writing-practices.pdf) do we participate in explicitly and invisibly**? From there, each of you must choose and refine a particular topic as a mode to explore one of your own networked writing practices. (More on this forthcoming.)

The main point of this data collection is not statistical insight nor applying quasi-experimental design strategies, but to explore, examine, and gain insight into your writing practices and how digital data permeates it. In doing so, we will try to understand how digital media communicates much more than what we originally thought.

## General process

Like any good project, this one begins with a simple, personal felt dissonance&mdash;a provocation that cannot be ignored. From there, you will do the following to complete your data collection:

<ol id="process-list">
  <li>
    <img class="image" src="/images/3844-datastory-topos.png" alt="Data-gathering image" />
    <div class="content">
      <h3>Consider &amp; combine topos</h3>
      <p>
        Define the basic parameters of your study through an invention process that plays with topics of import.</p>
    </div>
  </li>
  <li>
    <img class="image" src="/images/deardata-data-process-question.jpg" alt="How to distill a good set of questions." />
    <div class="content">
      <h3>Distill your data-story topic as research question(s)</h3>
      <p>Refine the topical parameters of your study with a sharp set of questions.</p>
    </div>
  </li>
  <li>
    <img class="image" src="/images/deardata-data-process-collectionplan.png" alt="Plan for data collection." />
    <div class="content">
      <h3>Plan data-collection strategies</h3>
      <p>Learn how to create a balance of well-planned and creative set of techniques.</p>
    </div>
  </li>
  <li>
    <img class="image" src="/images/posavec-data-gathering.png" alt="Collect the data." />
    <div class="content">
      <h3>Collect your data</h3>
      <p>Gather the data with your well-planned set of techniques. Make way for creative hacks along the way!</p>
    </div>
  </li>
</ol>

<!-- <ol>
  <li>Based on your questions, decide what your data points are and how to keep track of them. (This will involve creativity and dedication!)</li>
  <li>Gather the data</li>
  <li>Analyze the data by organizing, categorizing it, re-organizing it, etc.</li>
  <li>Find the story</li>
  <li>Decide on how to represent it visually</li>
  <li>Sketch out your visualization</li>
</ol> -->

Your sketch will serve as the inventive seed by which your narrative grows as you work through the next 3 projects: 1) An SVG representation of your visualization, 2) Videos that draw out the contextual details and refined points of the narrative for your website, and 3) the website that will tell the entire arch of your data story.

## Rubric

The following rubric has been modified from <a href="https://youtu.be/dwj22Fm3n5g?t=799" target="_blank">Posavec's explanation</a> about her own rules by which she assesses her data-work:

<ul>
  <li>
    Data integrity: Includes logging truthful changes, modifications, and/or omissions with data collection</li>
  <li>
    Consistently log your data in a Google Sheets spreadsheet every evening</li>
  <li>
    Contextualize data in spreadsheet with details / notes</li>
  <li>
    Follows basic clean data guidlines: Rows == Observation &amp; Columns == Data-type of observation and/or Major Categories</li>
</ul>
