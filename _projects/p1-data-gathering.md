## Description

The main goal of this course starts here: collecting a 5 days of data. In this first project, you will collect the data necessary to complete all of the subsequent media projects in this course. To guide this process, we will all share the following broader research question: **What [writing practices](/assets/docs/writing-practices.pdf) do we participate in explicitly and invisibly**? From there, each of you must choose and refine a particular topic as a mode to explore one of your own networked writing practices. (More on this forthcoming.)

The main point of this data collection is not statistical insight nor applying quasi-experimental design strategies, but to explore, examine, and gain insight into your writing practices and how digital data permeates it. In doing so, we will try to understand how digital media communicates much more than what we originally thought.

## General process

Like any good project, this one begins with a simple yet interesting question. From there, you must do the following:

<ol>
  <li>Based on your questions, decide what your data points are and how to keep track of them. (This will involve creativity and dedication!)</li>
  <li>Gather the data</li>
  <li>Analyze the data by organizing, categorizing it, re-organizing it, etc.</li>
  <li>Find the story</li>
  <li>Decide on how to represent it visually</li>
  <li>Sketch out your visualization</li>
</ol>

Your sketch will serve as the inventive seed by which your narrative grows as you work through the next 3 projects: 1) An SVG representation of your visualization, 2) Videos that draw out the contextual details and refined points of the narrative for your website, and 3) the website that will tell the entire arch of your data story.

## Rubric

Your data collection will be assessed as follows:

<ul>
  <li>
    Data integrity</li>
