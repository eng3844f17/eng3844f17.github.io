## Description

The main goal of this course begins with the following task: collecting a 5 days of data. In this first sub-project, you will collect the data necessary to complete all of the subsequent media projects in this course. To guide this process, we will all share the following broader research question: **What [writing practices](/assets/docs/writing-practices.pdf) do we participate in visibly and invisibly**? **What information do companies collect, organize, and combine based on my writing practices with their software/apps**? From there, each of you must choose and refine a particular topic as a mode to explore one of your own prominent, networked writing practices. Consider some of the following topics and issues to pursue further:

The main point of this data collection is not statistical insight nor applying quasi-experimental design strategies, but to explore, examine, and gain insight into your writing practices and how digital media and data permeate it. In doing so, we will try to understand how digital media performs and communicates much more than what we may have originally thought.

## General process

Like any good project, this one begins with a simple, personal felt dissonance&mdash;a provocation that cannot be ignored. From there, you will do the following to complete your data collection:

<ol class="visual-list">
  <li>
    <img class="image" src="/images/3844-datastory-topos.png" alt="Data-gathering image" />
    <div class="content">
      <h3>Consider &amp; combine topos</h3>
      <p>
        Define the basic parameters of your study through an invention process that plays with topics of import.</p>
    </div>
  </li>
  <li>
    <img class="image" src="/images/deardata-data-process-question.jpg" alt="How to distill a good set of questions." />
    <div class="content">
      <h3>Distill your data-story topic as research question(s)</h3>
      <p>Refine the topical parameters of your study with a sharp set of questions.</p>
    </div>
  </li>
  <li>
    <img class="image" src="/images/deardata-data-process-collectionplan.png" alt="Plan for data collection." />
    <div class="content">
      <h3>Plan data-collection strategies</h3>
      <p>Learn how to create a balance of well-planned and creative set of techniques.</p>
    </div>
  </li>
  <li>
    <img class="image" src="/images/posavec-data-gathering.png" alt="Collect the data." />
    <div class="content">
      <h3>Collect your data</h3>
      <p>Gather the data with your well-planned set of techniques, leaving room for creative hacks along the way!</p>
    </div>
  </li>
</ol>

Your data set will serve as the inventive seed by which your narrative grows as you work through the next 4 sub-projects: 1) A data visualization created in SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics); 2) Wireframes to help you sketch out a plan for your data-story website; 3) Videos that draw out the contextual details and refined points of the narrative for your website; and 4) A single-page website that will tell the entire arch of your data story.

## Rubric

The following rubric has been modified from <a href="https://youtu.be/dwj22Fm3n5g?t=799" target="_blank">Posavec's explanation</a> about her own rules by which she assesses her data-work:

<ul>
  <li>
    Data integrity: Includes logging truthful changes, modifications, and/or omissions with data collection</li>
  <li>
    Consistently log your data in a Google Sheets spreadsheet every evening</li>
  <li>
    Contextualize data in spreadsheet with details / notes</li>
  <li>
    Follows basic clean data guidlines: <b>Rows</b> == Observation; <b>Columns</b> == Data-type of observation and/or Major Categories</li>
</ul>
