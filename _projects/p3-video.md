## Description

After visualizing your data, you now have been able to solidify a main narrative thread for your website. Now, you will consider how to utilize video media for the site. Will you use video to introduce your data story, emphasize a particular point, or perhaps provide interesting insights into the data that your collected? You must decide how your video will best serve your narrative.

We will be using video editing software specific to your particular operating system.

As a basic introduction, we will use the Inkscape application to create our draft visualization as a SVG file. We will learn about its basic document structure (see image below), and prep it for our future data-story website.

## General process

1. Learn about the basic data visualization conventions.
2. Based on your data, you must choose what conventions help you tell your data-story meaningfully.
3. Sketch your data visualization by hand.
4. Create your drawing as an SVG.
5. Clean your SVG for the web, making it semantically rich.


## Rubric

- Overall design expresses your categorical relationships
- Incorporates meaningful use of space and shapes to define and express your data story
- Aesthetic defensibly appropriate for the topic
- Legend articulates relationships clearly
- Incorporates contextual details that amplify your main narrative
- Semantically rich SVG markup
