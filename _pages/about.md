Welcome to *ENGL 3844 &ndash; Writing &amp; Digital Media*! In this course, I introduce fundamental practices and emerging theories of writing <i>with and for</i> digital media. We will learn basic authoring in web-development syntaxes, critical interpretation of online sources, social media management, and topics of computational abstraction for writers. This course is active and production-heavy. The tangible outcome includes producing a website that cohesively integrates different modalities afforded by text, images, audio, and video befit for a particular rhetorical genre.

Specific to this section, we will examine how traditional modalities of written communication have been intertwined with digital and computational modalities. For instance, how might our conception of writing and communication change if we understand URLs as texts, or the data that networked devices and social media collect on users as texts, or  What can we learn about written communication if we understand digital data &ndash; their formats, structures, and content &ndash; as texts?

Main objective: Learn how distributed sources of data &ndash; data collected by multiple apps, devices, and services &ndash; can be combined, re-purposed, and made meaningful in dynamic ways for a variety of audiences. Audiences include co.-to-users, co.-to-stakeholders, algorithms written by companies for a variety of reasons, algorithms written by people outside of the normal domain of consideration, etc.

Abrev: Students will explore and subsequently examine the multiple audience interceding across their networked writing lives.
