Welcome to ENGL3844, Virginia Tech’s English course focusing on introductory web building, multimodal composition, digital identity and social media. This course will examine our interactions with technology vis-a-vis writing from a variety of perspectives. We’ll first learn introductory coding in .html/.css to build a platform for the future multimodal compositions we’ll compose in class throughout the rest of the term. Next, we’ll research, design and develop audio and video compositions to explore the complexity of “writing” in multimodal genres. Finally, we’ll also consider the ways that digital media technologies shape our perceptions of ourselves, each other and our communities.

To begin, check out Getting Started.
