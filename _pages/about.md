Welcome to *ENGL 3844 &ndash; Writing &amp; Digital Media*! In this course, I introduce fundamental practices and emerging theories of writing <i>with and for</i> digital media. We will learn basic authoring in web-development syntaxes, critical interpretation of online sources, social media management, and topics of computational abstraction for writers.

This course is active and production-heavy. Yet, we also will challenge our conceptual understanding of writing and digital media. Accordingly, I divide the learning outcomes by 2 main categories: conceptual and production. Your tangible outcomes include producing a website that cohesively integrate text, images, audio, and video befit for a particular rhetorical genre. The

I divide the outcomes by

Specific to this section, we will examine how traditional modalities of written communication have been intertwined with digital and computational modes of writing. For instance, how might our conception of writing change if we understand URLs as texts? Or the data that networked devices and social media collect on users? Or digital images and their formats? Essentially, *what can we learn about written communication if we understand digital data &ndash; their formats, structures, and content &ndash; as texts*?

Main objective: Learn how distributed sources of data &ndash; data collected by multiple apps, devices, and services &ndash; can be combined, re-purposed, and made meaningful in dynamic ways for a variety of audiences. Audiences include co.-to-users, co.-to-stakeholders, algorithms written by companies for a variety of reasons, algorithms written by people outside of the normal domain of consideration, etc.

Abrev: Students will explore and subsequently examine the multiple audience interceding across their networked writing lives.
