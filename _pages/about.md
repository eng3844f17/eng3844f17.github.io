Welcome to **ENGL 3844 &ndash; Writing &amp; Digital Media**! In this course, I introduce fundamental practices and emerging theories of writing <i>with and for</i> digital media. We will learn basic authoring in web-development syntaxes, critical interpretation of online sources, social media management, and topics of computational abstraction for writers.

## Describing the types of learning objectives

This course is active and production-heavy. We also will challenge our conceptual understanding of writing and digital media. Accordingly, I divide the learning objectives by 2 main categories: conceptual and production.

### Production-based objectives

Your production-based objectives include designing and developing a website that cohesively integrates text, images, audio, and video befit for a particular genre.

<ul class="hokie-shade">
  <li>
    Independently produce digital media, including photos, images, sound and video.</li>
  <li>
    Collaborate with others to create digital media including photos, images, sound and video.</li>
  <li>
    Recognize and use basic computational authoring syntaxes of <code>.html</code> & <code>.css</code>.</li>
  <li>
    Recognize and use copyleft resources to produce digital media.</li>
</ul>

### Conceptual objectives

You will explore and subsequently examine the multiple audiences interceding across your networked writing lives. The conceptual objectives involve examining how traditional modalities of written communication have been intertwined with digital and computational modes of writing. For example, how might our conception of writing change if we understand URLs as texts? Or the data that networked devices and social media collect on users as texts? Or digital images and their formats as texts with organized values and signs? Essentially, *what can we learn about written communication if we understand digital data &ndash; their formats, structures, and content &ndash; as texts*?

<ul class="hokie-shade">
  <li>
    Inventory digital media technologies and appraise their influence and import over time.</li>
  <li>
    Learn how digital data are written and used as texts for a variety of audiences.</li>
  <li>
    Apply a critical genre awareness of digital media to compose various digital media genres.</li>
</ul>

Main objective: Learn how distributed sources of data &ndash; data collected by multiple apps, devices, and services &ndash; can be combined, re-purposed, and made meaningful in dynamic ways for a variety of audiences. Audiences include co.-to-users, co.-to-stakeholders, algorithms written by companies for a variety of reasons, algorithms written by people outside of the normal domain of consideration, etc.
